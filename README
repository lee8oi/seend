# Seend is a seen script that will tell you how long ago the bot
# last seen the specified nick, what channel they were on, and what their
# last message was to that channel. It also allows you to do partial
# nick searches using * and even lets you .seen yourself!
#
# Seend uses an automatic system for backing up and restoring seen
# data. Which also includes the .seend partyline command for manually
# backing up and restoring seen data.
